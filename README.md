## Code Structure

### Problem 1:
- The C code is in `questionOne.c`.
- The Python script for plotting is `questionOnePlot.py`.

### Problem 3:
- The C code for this problem is in `stream.c`.

### Problem 4:
- The C code for the pi computation is in `pi-serialel.c`.
- The Python script for plotting is `plot.py`.

### Data and Plots:
- CSV files are provided for two scenarios:
  - 1,000 iterations.
  - 10,000,000,000 iterations.
- Both scenarios were run five times.
- The Python script calculates and plots the average values from these runs.
